# huntress_ctf2024
Locale for everything related to the CTF 2024 from Huntress. Includes writeups (when auth for released), hints, tools, and other helpful guides.

NOTE: If you are familiar and able, I will allow collaborators to have their own subfolder to use with Git to upload as need be. If you don't know what I am talking about - don't worry about it. 
I HIGHLY recommend having a github account so I can add you as a collaborator.

If you completed and submitted a Flag for a Challenge, you are responsible for the writeup on it (see note below for release timeframes). Please do not complete challenges if you have no intention of sharing your knowledge.


NOTE #2: The Huntress CTF 2024 is a month long (during the Month of October). PLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD ANY FORMAL COMPLETE WRITEUPS UNTIL NOV 1ST 2024. It is against the rules to have writeups posted before the game is complete due to eligibility for prizes.
We can be disqualified and/or worse, banned from participating in CTF events from Huntress in the future. PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS.

For now, suggestions, such as hints, tools to use, commands, scripts to use, etc.... are all allowed and welcomed. They just can't be a full-fledged writeup of completion.

Other suggestions, such as setups for the CTF, what to use, and other support is also welcome.

Please reach out to me if you have any comments or suggestions.
